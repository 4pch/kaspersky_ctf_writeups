Switch to mobile mode → In Chrome/Edge, open DevTools → Device Toolbar, pick a phone profile and set it to responsive, making sure the canvas covers most of the screen.

Movement trick → On desktop, normal controls don’t work well, but in mobile emulation you can click and hold on specific areas of the screen to move forward/backward. Using this, I navigated my way toward the house in the scene.

The statues → There are 3 statues. You need to zoom into the first one. Inside it, there’s a sort of spiral/curve ball shape.

Finding the flag → When you zoom in at just the right angle, you start seeing fragments of text. By rotating/zooming from different angles, I revealed multiple fragments.

Reconstruction → I manually joined those pieces together and got the full flag.
